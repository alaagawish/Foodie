# Foodie
Foodie is a food application that helps you to:
+ Add your favourite meals
+ Plan for your week
+ Backup your data
+ Add to your mobile calendar
+ Guide you to cook the chosen meal

# Implementation
+ We used Android studio to create Foodie, Firebase to backup data, Room for local storage for retrieving data after backup, Shared Preference for keeping the user login even after he closed the app but not logged out, caching data when turning off wifi/mobile data
+ We also facilitate to user to login by different ways:
  + regular email and password
  + google
  + skip mood (guest mood)
